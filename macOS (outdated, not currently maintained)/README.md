# macOS Folder

### [not currently being actively maintained, and many versions behind. Please use the Windows/Linux version instead â€” it's cross platform and should work on macOS]

This folder contains code specific to the macOS port of Writing Tools.

## Credits
The macOS port is being developed by **Jeff Kurcz (kurcz)**.  
GitHub: [https://github.com/kurcz](https://github.com/kurcz)

Some of the improvements in the v4 release still need to be merged to this macOS codebase.
