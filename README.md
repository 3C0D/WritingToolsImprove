## üöÄ What is Writing Tools?

Writing Tools is an Apple Intelligence-inspired application for Windows that supercharges your writing with AI. It lets you fix up grammar and more with one  hotkey press, system-wide. It's currently the world's most intelligent system-wide grammar assistant.

### üåü Why Choose Writing Tools?

Aside from being the only Windows program that works like Apple's Writing Tools:

- **Smarter AI**: Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model, a >10x larger & more intelligent model than Apple Intelligence!
- **System-wide Functionality**: Works instantly in any application where you can select text. Does not overwrite or mess with your clipboard.
- **Completely free and Open-source**: No subscriptions, no hidden costs. Bloat-free & uses pretty much 0% of your CPU.
- **Privacy-focused**: Your API key and config files stay on *your* device. NO logging, diagnostic collection, tracking, or ads. Invoked *only* on your command.
- üÜï **Supports Many Languages**: Works for any language! It can even *translate* text across many languages better than Google Translate (type *"translate to x language"* in the `Describe your change...` box).
- üÜï **Themes & Dark Mode**: Choose between **2 themes**: a blurry gradient theme and a plain theme that resembles the Windows + V pop-up! Also has full **dark mode support**.
- **Customizable**: Set your own hotkey for quick access.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Proofread**: The smartest grammar and spelling corrector. Sorry not sorry, Grammarly Premium.
- **Rewrite**: Improve the phrasing of your text.
- **Make Friendly/Professional**: Adjust the tone of your writing.
- **Summarize**: Create concise summaries of longer texts.
- **Extract Key Points**: Highlight the most important information.
- **Create Tables**: Convert text into a structured Markdown table (use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Markdown-to-Excel](https://tableconvert.com/markdown-to-excel) to work with the markdown table).
- **Custom Instructions**: Give specific directions for text modifications (e.g. `Translate to French`).

## üñ± How to Use

1. Select any text in any application.
2. Press your hotkey (default: Ctrl+Space).
3. Choose an option from the popup menu or enter a custom instruction.
4. Watch as your text is magically improved!

## üõ† Installation

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest `Writing Tools.zip` file.
   
2. Extract it where you want, run `Writing Tools.exe`, and enjoy! :D

   *Note: If you extract Writing Tools into a protected system folder like Program Files, you'll need to run it as administrator on the first launch or it won't be able to create its config file (in the same folder as its exe).*
   
4. To let it automatically start when you boot your PC, add a shortcut of the `Writing Tools.exe` to the Windows Start-Up folder (Open Run and type `shell:startup` to get to this folder). 

## üîí Privacy

I believe strongly in protecting your privacy. Writing Tools:
- Only sends text to Google (encrypted) when you *explicitly* use one of the options.

   If you have a paid API key, the text will never be used to train Gemini (you can get $300 of paid API credits for free with Google Cloud's free trial! Just click "Set up Billing" to the right of your API key on the [AI Studio page](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

   If you don't have the paid API, Google may anonymise your text and use it to train their models.

- Only stores your API key locally on your device.
- Does not collect or store any of your writing data by itself. It doesn't even collect general logs, so it's super light and privacy-friendly.

## üí° Tips

- Use "Proofread" for quick grammar and spelling checks. Better than Grammarly premium can ever be :)
- Try "Rewrite" when you want to improve the entire phrasing.
- "Summarize" is great for condensing long articles or documents.
- Experiment with custom instructions for specific writing needs.

## üë®‚Äçüíª To run Writing Tools directly from the code

If you prefer to run it directly from the `main.py` file:

1. Download the code by clicking this button above:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c6cab79-4918-451c-9ad1-1bbcf8472275)

2. Right-click the folder of the code you downloaded, and click Open in Terminal.
   You'll only have to do this once: Type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   Of course, you'll need to have [Python installed!](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Any time you want to run the program, just type `pythonw main.py` in your terminal. That's it! üéâ

## üêû Known Issues
On some devices, the hotkey detection or text selection detection sometimes acts up or does not work correctly.

To fix it, just restart Writing Tools (you can close it by right-clicking its taskbar tray icon and clicking Exit, or with Task Manager).

This issue is being investigated ‚Äî it seems to be due to an unreliable hotkey detection API.

## üë®‚Äçüíª To compile the application yourself:

Here's how to compile it with PyInstaller:

1. Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
2. Run the build script: `pyinstaller-build-script.py`
