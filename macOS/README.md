# Writing Tools for macOS

This is a new, **native macOS port of Writing Tools**, created entirely by @Aryamirsepasi ðŸŽ‰

Core functionality works well, and it is still an ongoing work in progress.

---

## Working Features
- All of the tools, including the new response windows and the manual chat option.
- Gemini Support.
- Initial Setup, Settings, and About pages.

---

## Not Yet Available
- OpenAI and Local LLM Integration.
- The Gradient Theme (Dark Mode and Light Mode are supported).
- More refined positioning logic for the popup window to follow the cursor correctly.

---

## System Requirements
Due to the accessibility features the app uses (e.g., automatically selecting the window containing the text and pasting the updated version), **the minimum macOS version required is 14.0**.

     ```

3. **Open the Project in Xcode**
   - Open Xcode.
   - Select **File > Open** from the menu bar.
   - Navigate to the `macOS` folder and select it.

4. **Generate the Project File**
   - Run the following command to generate the `.xcodeproj` file:
     ```bash
     swift package generate-xcodeproj
     ```

5. **Build the Project**
   - Select your target device as **My Mac** in Xcode.
