# macOS Folder

This is a new, **native macOS port of Writing Tools**, created entirely by @Aryamirsepasi ðŸŽ‰

Core functionality works well, and it is still an ongoing work in progress.

### Working:
- All of the tools, including the new response windows and the manual chat option.
- Gemini Support.
- Initial Setup, Settings, and About pages.

### Not yet available:
- OpenAI and Local LLM Integration.
- The Gradient Theme, but it has Dark Mode and Light Mode.
- More refined positioning logic for where the popup opens (the cursor-position-following-code needs more work).
