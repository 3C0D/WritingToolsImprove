# Writing Tools for macOS

This is a new, **native macOS port of Writing Tools**, created entirely by @Aryamirsepasi ðŸŽ‰

Core functionality works well, and it is still an ongoing work in progress.

---

## Working Features
- All of the tools, including the new response windows and the manual chat option.
- Input Window even when no text is selected
- Gemini, OpenAI and Local LLM Support.
- The Gradient Theme (Dark Mode and Light Mode are supported).
- Initial Setup, Settings, and About pages.

---

## Not Yet Available
- All of the original port's features are now available; however, more optimizations and improvements are coming soon.

---

## System Requirements
Due to the accessibility features the app uses (e.g., automatically selecting the window containing the text and pasting the updated version), **the minimum macOS version required is 14.0**.
