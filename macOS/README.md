# Writing Tools for macOS

This is a new, **native macOS port of Writing Tools**, created entirely by @Aryamirsepasi ðŸŽ‰

Core functionality works well, and it is still an ongoing work in progress.

## System Requirements
Due to the accessibility features the app uses (e.g., automatically selecting the window containing the text and pasting the updated version), **the minimum macOS version required is 14.0**. You also have to allow this accessibility access in System Settings. 
> System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Accessibility â†’ Press the plus (+) button â†’ Add *writing-tools* and enable access.
